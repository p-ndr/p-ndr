<h3 align=center>Hello, Nerdanel here.</h3>
<br>
<p align=center>
The theoretical computer scientist (aspiring logician) and translator with an interest in art.
<br>
I also walk and run a lot. My main hobbies are reading and web-surfing. <br> Most of the time I appear plain, but trust me, I'm a good person.
<br>
I mostly code in Python, Rust and Coq. I love cpp, c, assembly and any other low-level language.<br>
I'm very fond of low-level programming.<br>
