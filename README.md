<h3 align=center>Hello, Nerdanel here.</h3>
<br>
<p align=center>
The theoretical computer scientist (aspiring logician) and translator with an interest in art.
<br>
My hobbies include drawing, reading, listening to music, learning languages (Chinese, French) and walking. <br> I no longer appear plain, as I always come outside with a light makeup and tailor made outfit. It feels good to look nice.
<br>
I mostly code in Python, Rust and Coq. I love cpp, c, assembly and other similar languages.<br>
I'm very fond of low-level programming.<br>
