I study Computer Science, read, translate and code. I don't do what most nerds or dweebs do, e.g. watching Anime, being a Die Hard fan of Breaking Bad
or Mr. Robot, headbanging non-stop and listening to the most obscure musicians.
<br>
I also walk and run a lot. My main hobbies are reading and web-surfing. <br> Most of the time I appear plain, but trust me, I'm a good person.
<br>
I mostly code in Python, Rust and Coq. My work stack is C# but I don't like it.<br>
But in the end of the day, I'm a student of theoretical CS, and therefore I mostly code in Coq.
