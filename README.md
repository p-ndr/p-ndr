<h3 align=center>Hello, Nerdanel here.</h3>
<br>
<p align=center>
A theoretical computer scientist (aspiring logician) and translator with an interest in art.
<br>
My hobbies include drawing, reading, listening to music, and learning languages (Chinese, French and German). <br> I no longer appear plain; I always come outside with light makeup and a tailor-made outfit. It feels good to look nice.
<br>
I mostly code in Python, Rust, and Coq. I love CPP, C, assembly, and other similar languages.<br>
I'm very fond of low-level programming.<br>
