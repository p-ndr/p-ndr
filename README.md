I study Computer Science, read, listen to music, and code.
<br>
I also walk and run a lot. I have a huge lot of hobbies too. <br> Most of the time I appear plain, but trust me, I'm good. Very good.
<br>
I mostly code in Python and C#. But I'm open to experimenting different things.<br>Haskell has become a new favourite, as I spend my time around theoretical cs.
