<p align=center>
The theoretical computer scientist and translator with an interest in art.
<br>
I also walk and run a lot. My main hobbies are reading and web-surfing. <br> Most of the time I appear plain, but trust me, I'm a good person.
<br>
I mostly code in Python, Rust and Coq.<br>
Update: I got rid of C#!
