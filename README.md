<h3 align=center>Hello, Nerdanel here.</h3>
<br>
<p align=center>
A theoretical computer scientist (aspiring logician) with an interest in art and fondness of low-level programming and terminals.
<br>
I draw, read, listen to music, learn languages (Chinese, French and German) and make-up art in my spare time. Above all these, I love spending time with my friends. 
<br>
I mostly code in Python, Rust, and Coq.<br>
