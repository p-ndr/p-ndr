<h3 align=center>Hello, Nerdanel here.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p align=center>
The Computer Scientist and Translator with an interest in art who isn't a nerd.
<br>
I also walk and run a lot. My main hobbies are reading and web-surfing. <br> Most of the time I appear plain, but trust me, I'm a good person.
<br>
I mostly code in Python, Rust and Coq.<br>
But in the end of the day, I'm a student of theoretical CS, and therefore I mostly code in Coq.<br>
Update: I got rid of C#!
